# DPC_Magnetic_Field_mapping_ThemisZ
Magnetic field Mapping (MFM) with arrows for ThemisZ DPC component
You need to have your file saved in .png file.
The file output in version 2 is saved in a separate folder called "Output".
Currently, the code is written in such a way that :
  1. North-east is Green hue.
  2. South-west should be magenta/pink.
  3. Other hue will follow ON.
But this hue configuration can be changed by adjusting the "adjusted_hue_channel_correct"
The arrow length depicts the strength of the magnetic field.
The arrow direction depicts the direction of the magnetic field.
